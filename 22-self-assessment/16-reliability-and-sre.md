### 1. When is a retry harmful, and what controls do you add to prevent retry storms?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

Retries are harmful when failures are caused by **overload** — more retries = more load = longer outage. AWS's Builders' Library quantifies the blast: a 5-layer stack each retrying 3 times can amplify backend load 243-fold.

Controls:
1. **Retry only transient errors** — never on 4xx (except 408/429), never on business rule failures.
2. **Exponential backoff with full jitter**: `sleep = random(0, min(cap, base * 2^attempt))`.
3. **Bound attempts** — 3 is a sane default; more is rarely better.
4. **Retry budget / token bucket** — every successful call refills; retries drain. When empty, retries are rejected locally. AWS's adaptive retry mode (shipped in several AWS SDKs) uses this pattern.
5. **Idempotency-first** — retries on a non-idempotent `POST` without an idempotency key double-charge customers.

Polly: `AddRetry` with `BackoffType = Exponential`, `UseJitter = true`, `MaxRetryAttempts = 3`. For HTTP specifically, `AddStandardResilienceHandler` gets these defaults right.

### 2. Explain full jitter vs equal jitter vs decorrelated jitter and which you'd pick by default.

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

From the AWS Architecture Blog *Exponential Backoff And Jitter* (Marc Brooker):

- **Full jitter**: `sleep = random(0, min(cap, base * 2^attempt))` — randomizes the whole delay. AWS's test found it used the **least total work**.
- **Equal jitter**: `sleep = cap/2 + random(0, cap/2)` — keeps a minimum delay. AWS found it was the **worst performer** of the three (still better than no jitter).
- **Decorrelated jitter**: `sleep = min(cap, random(base, 3 * last_sleep))` — self-correlates with recent sleep; close to full jitter in performance.

Default pick: **full jitter**. Only deviate if you have a specific reason to keep a minimum delay (e.g. protecting a peer that genuinely needs breathing room even after a fast failure).

### 3. Walk me through the Polly v8 circuit-breaker state machine and its default thresholds.

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

Four states (Polly v8 `CircuitBreakerStrategyOptions`):

- **Closed** — normal; failures counted within `SamplingDuration`.
- **Open** — short-circuits with `BrokenCircuitException` for `BreakDuration`.
- **HalfOpen** — one probe call; success closes, failure re-opens.
- **Isolated** — manually opened; throws `IsolatedCircuitException`.

Defaults (from `pollydocs.org`):

| Property | Default |
|---|---|
| `FailureRatio` | 0.1 (10%) |
| `MinimumThroughput` | 100 |
| `SamplingDuration` | 30 s |
| `BreakDuration` | 5 s |

The critical nuance: the circuit opens only when **both** conditions are met — minimum throughput reached AND failure ratio exceeded. A low-traffic endpoint with one failure won't trip, which is what you want.

Pipeline ordering: **Timeout → Retry → Circuit Breaker → call**. The breaker should see the results of retries; otherwise a single retry burst can't trip what is a real outage.

### 4. Polly v8 "doesn't have a bulkhead" — how do you get bulkhead isolation today?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

Polly v7 had a distinct `Bulkhead` policy. In v8 it was **replaced by `ConcurrencyLimiter`**, which is a specialized rate limiter. The v8 migration guide states explicitly: *"In v7, the bulkhead was presented as an individual strategy. In v8, it's not separately exposed because it's essentially a specialized type of rate limiter: the `ConcurrencyLimiter`."*

Implementation uses `Polly.RateLimiting` (backed by `System.Threading.RateLimiting`):

```csharp
var pipeline = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()
    .AddConcurrencyLimiter(
        permitLimit: 20,  // max concurrent executions
        queueLimit: 5)    // queue beyond that; then reject
    .Build();
```

When the limit is reached and the queue is full, the strategy throws `RateLimiterRejectedException`. Sizing heuristic: measure p99 latency of the downstream × target rps × 1.2 headroom.

### 5. What is the cascading timeout rule and why does it matter?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

**Each hop's timeout must be shorter than its caller's.** If user → gateway → A → B → DB all have independent timeouts, and the DB timeout (30 s) exceeds A's timeout (10 s), then A gives up before the DB has finished — the work is wasted, and retries amplify the waste.

Senior solution: **deadline propagation**. Pass a `CancellationToken` linked to the caller's remaining time budget. gRPC does this automatically (the call carries a deadline; intermediate hops forward the remaining time). Plain HTTP requires you to do it manually via `CancellationTokenSource`.

Also: `HttpClient.Timeout` default is **100 seconds** — far too long for interactive paths. Set a conservative outer bound there, and use a per-request `CancellationToken` for the real limit. Microsoft's docs: *"only the shorter of the two timeouts will apply."*

### 6. A gRPC client sets a deadline of 2 s. The server takes 2.5 s to respond. What does the server observe vs the client?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

The official gRPC blog spells this out: *"both the client and server make their own independent and local determination about whether the remote procedure call was successful."*

- **Client**: receives `StatusCode.DeadlineExceeded` at 2 s; from the client's view the call failed.
- **Server**: may have completed the work and sent the response successfully. The server's view is "success."

Consequence: **idempotency still matters even with deadlines**. A payment call that "failed" at the client can still have debited the customer. Always use idempotency keys for mutating operations across a network, regardless of how reliable your timeouts are.

### 7. Name the five Principles of Chaos (from principlesofchaos.org) and explain "minimize blast radius."

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

The five advanced principles:

1. **Build a Hypothesis around Steady State Behavior** — measurable system-level metric, predicted before injection.
2. **Vary Real-world Events** — simulate things that actually happen (zone loss, slow disk, DNS flap).
3. **Run Experiments in Production** — staging is a lie about production.
4. **Automate Experiments to Run Continuously** — manual chaos runs once; automated runs daily.
5. **Minimize Blast Radius** — start with the smallest slice that can prove the hypothesis; expand as confidence grows.

*Minimize blast radius* is the safety clause that makes *run in production* acceptable: a single canary pod, a 1% traffic shadow, a single zone — not the entire fleet. AWS FIS enforces this structurally via **stop conditions** tied to CloudWatch alarms: the experiment aborts automatically if blast radius expands.

### 8. Describe the four roles in the Incident Command System and why they must be separate people for large incidents.

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

Google SRE's ICS (from *Managing Incidents*):

| Role | Job |
|---|---|
| **IC — Incident Commander** | Holds state, delegates, runs the bridge. Does **not** fix. |
| **Ops Lead** | The only person touching the system. *"The operations team should be the only group modifying the system during an incident."* |
| **Comms Lead** | Status page, exec updates, customer comms. Keeps the living incident doc current. |
| **Planning Lead** | Long-horizon: bug tracking, resource requests, handoffs across time zones. |

Why separate? The failure mode is **freelancing** — two engineers independently rolling back while a third pushes a hotfix, conversations spread across five channels, nobody tracks what's been tried. Separating the roles forces serialization through the IC and keeps changes single-threaded through Ops.

Small incident: one person can be IC + Comms. Big incident (cross-team, customers watching): must be separate humans.

### 9. What makes a postmortem "blameless" without becoming accountability-free?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

Blameless does **not** mean nameless or consequence-free. It means analysis focuses on **systemic gaps that permitted the mistake**, not the individual who made it. Google SRE workbook, describing a good postmortem: *"The authors focused on the gaps in system design that permitted undesirable failure modes."*

Test: does the root-cause section describe a *control that was missing* (no integration test for the real pool, no rollback on error spike) or a *person who slipped up* (Alice deployed the bug)? The first is useful; the second is a dead end.

Accountability still exists:
- Action items have **named owners + due dates + priority**.
- AI completion rates are tracked across incidents; chronically unclosed AIs are a team problem escalated to leadership.
- Service owners sign off on postmortems.

The rule is: **assume the human acted reasonably given what they knew**. Then ask why the system let their reasonable action break production. That question produces changes; "Alice should be more careful" does not.

### 10. Why is "5 Whys" a weak root-cause tool, and what do you use instead?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

5 Whys feels rigorous but has three structural weaknesses:

1. **Forces a single causal chain.** Real incidents have multiple simultaneous causes — a failed test *and* a broken alert *and* a manual deploy bypass. 5 Whys picks one and hides the others.
2. **Stops at the human-shaped answer.** *"Why did the deploy fail? Because Alice pushed it."* — the ladder breaks exactly where the systemic question starts.
3. **Confirmation bias.** The first plausible 5-step chain feels "deep enough" and is accepted.

Better:
- **Causal diagram / fault tree** — draw multiple contributing chains converging on the outcome.
- **STAMP / CAST** (Nancy Leveson) — treat the system as a control loop; ask which safety controls were missing, inadequate, or disabled.
- **Separate "root cause" and "contributing factors" sections** in the postmortem template. This alone forces breadth.

At minimum, if you use 5 Whys, run it **for each contributing factor independently** and reconcile. One chain is never enough.

### 11. Given SLO = 99.9% over 28 days and current error rate = 1%, what is the burn rate and what do you do?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

Budget = `1 - SLO = 0.1%`. Current rate = 1%. Burn rate = `1.0% / 0.1% = 10`. At that rate, a 28-day budget is exhausted in **2.8 days**.

Action depends on the budget-policy tier:
- **Page, not ticket.** Multi-window multi-burn-rate alerts (Google SRE) typically page at ≈14× for short windows, ≈6× for longer ones — 10× triggers a short-window page.
- **Announce the burn** — budget policy may already require a feature freeze once the remaining budget crosses a red threshold.
- **Diagnose fast** — is this a real outage, a deploy regression, a single misbehaving client? Mitigate the most likely cause (rollback, scale out, failover).
- **Stop experiments** — chaos runs, risky migrations pause until burn rate returns to baseline.

The policy decisions are **pre-written, not argued mid-incident**. Arguing policy in the war room is how freezes get overridden.

### 12. Product wants to ship a risky feature next sprint. Reliability is at 75% of the error budget consumed. How do you navigate?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

The error-budget policy is the tool. You do not negotiate the facts; you apply the pre-agreed policy.

Example standard policy:
- **Green (>50% remaining)**: launches allowed.
- **Yellow (25–50%)**: launches allowed, no large-surface migrations, reliability prioritized alongside features.
- **Red (<25%)**: freeze non-critical launches; sprint goes to reliability.

At 75% consumed → 25% remaining → **Red**. The risky feature does not ship this sprint.

Frame it to Product:
1. **State the policy** — *"per our error-budget policy, we're in Red. Non-critical launches are paused."*
2. **Anchor on shared interest** — Product wants velocity **sustainably**. Burning the last of the budget makes the next three sprints worse.
3. **Offer a path** — *"if we close AI-7 and AI-12 from last month's incidents, we project recovery by Thursday. Launch slides by one sprint."*
4. **Escalate only on disagreement** — the policy was signed by leadership. If Product wants to override, they go to the same leadership that signed it. Do not override silently; override in writing.

The senior point: **freezes that get overridden once will always be overridden**. Either hold the policy, or update it — never both.

### 13. What is exponential backoff with jitter, and why does "jitter" matter?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

On a retry, wait `base × 2^n` seconds (exponential). **Jitter** adds randomness so retries don't all hit the downstream at the same time.

Without jitter → **thundering herd**. 10 000 clients retry together after 1 s, together after 2 s, together after 4 s. The dependency gets periodic waves and never recovers.

With jitter → retries are smeared across the window, the dependency sees a gentler curve.

Variants (from the AWS Architecture Blog):
- **Full jitter** — `sleep = random(0, base × 2^n)`. Recommended default.
- **Equal jitter** — half the expected delay is fixed, half random.
- **Decorrelated jitter** — each attempt's delay is a random function of the previous attempt's delay.

Polly v8 / `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience` enables jitter by default when you call `AddStandardResilienceHandler()` — inspect the retry strategy before turning it off.

### 14. What problem does the bulkhead pattern solve?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

A **bulkhead** isolates resources (connections, threads, semaphores) per dependency so a meltdown in one cannot drain resources that other dependencies need.

Concrete scenario: your service depends on a user API, an orders API, and a payments API, all through one shared `HttpClient` with a connection pool of 100. The user API starts hanging. Within seconds, every one of those 100 connections is stuck waiting on the user API. Orders and payments traffic can no longer get a connection — your whole service goes down because of one sick dependency.

With bulkheads: 30 connections reserved for users, 30 for orders, 30 for payments, 10 spare. User API hangs → only the user bulkhead fills up. Orders and payments keep working.

In Polly v8 / `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`, the bulkhead is expressed as `AddConcurrencyLimiter()` per named / typed client. Size it so the dependency's worst-case latency × the limiter's concurrency ≤ the downstream's real capacity.

### 15. What is a postmortem, and what makes one "blameless"?

<details>
<summary>Reveal answer</summary>

A **postmortem** is a structured write-up after an incident: what happened, timeline, root cause(s), customer impact, action items. It's a learning artifact, not a punishment tool.

**Blameless** means:
- Focus on **systems and conditions**, not individuals. "The deploy tool accepted a config with a typo" — not "Alice typed a bad config."
- Assume everyone acted reasonably with the information they had at the time. Hindsight bias is the enemy.
- Action items target **systems** (guardrails, tests, alerts, docs, training) — not people ("be more careful").

Why it matters: engineers who know they'll be blamed will **hide** mistakes — delaying detection next time. Blameless postmortems surface the weak points the next incident would have found anyway.

Google's SRE book has a good template; keep the artifact public to the org so the whole team learns, not just the on-call who ran it.
